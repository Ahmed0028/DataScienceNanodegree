In a nutshell, in the unsupervised learning our inputs (training data) are unlabeled and we have no output results to validate efficiency of the learning process. 
However, once the training process is complete, we are able to label our data. The described process is similar to how humans acquire knowledge through experience. 
Like a child who makes the first steps in the world, our unsupervised machine lacks guidance and experience. 
Even though the machine works in the dark, it somehow manages to extract features and patterns from the probability distributions of
data (e.g images, texts) which are fed to it.
